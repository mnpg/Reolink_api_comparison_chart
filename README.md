Two kind of documentations
 * Official folder : documentations taken from differents sources.
 * Unofficial folder : unofficial documentations based on 5MP Reolink cameras (AI and not AI) -sorry, all the documentations are in french but easy to translate-

AND

 * Tips & Tricks : This folder contains some tips or tricks found on Reolink Cameras
 * Bash-scripts folder : Contains examples, based on the [bash script rl-api from @jasonk gist github](https://gist.github.com/jasonk/4772d1cd5154069cfc9eed07acb2057a), to configure or define features that aren't found in Home Automation Solutions.
